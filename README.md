# Project-2
Our second coding bootcamp project


Functionality:
I. Data Input
    A. Required fields
        1. Item name (VARCHAR)
        2. Item category, e.g. electronics, appliances, etc. (VARCHAR)
    B. Optional fields
        1. Item location (VARCHAR or photo?)
        2. Item description (VARCHAR)
        3. Item purchase price (FLOAT(6, 2))
        4. Warranty end date (DATE)
        5. Serial number (VARCHAR)
        *6. Photo of item
     C. Fields generated by developer and saving along with the data
        1. User name and password saving info
        2. Unique user identifier
II. Search area
    A. Search by
        1. Item
        2. Category
        3. Warranty end date
    B. Options
        1. New item entry area doubles as edit area (?)
        2. Clicking on item name populates editable fields (not sure if we want to go this route, but something that is editable would be really nice)
        *3. Due date reminder set on/off
III. Tables needed (this needs further discussion, scenario will be different in multi-user case)
    1. Log in user info saving table
    2. If each category has the same attributes, then one main table to hold all data info
IV. Very mobile responsive - so much easier to use if you can just wander the house with phone/tablet
V. New technology ideas
    *1. Saving a photo (would this count?)
    *2. Button to create printer friendly page and then button to print
    *3. Export to spreadsheet
    *4. Unique user key generation (key + password)
    *5. Graph plot (for insurance bills?)

# Project-2
Our second coding bootcamp project

This app will allow the user to develop a catalouged inventory of their home goods.

The user will land on a home page that will give them the option to enter a new item or view items. Viewed items will be edited or deleted.

There is one main database and two relational databases. The relational will be for categories of items, e.g. appliances or electronics, and locations for items, e.g. living room or kitchen. Category and location are selectable via dropdown.

Entering new items and editing existing items will be done by models.

# Project-2
Our second coding bootcamp project

This app will allow the user to develope a cataloged inventory of their home goods.

The user will land on home page that will give him/her the option to enter a new item or view items. Viewed items will be editable or deletable.

There is one main database and 2 relational databases. The relational will be for categories of items, e.g. appliances or electronics, and locations for items, e.g. living room or kitchen. Category and location are selectable via dropdown.

Entering new items and editing existing items will be done by modals.
